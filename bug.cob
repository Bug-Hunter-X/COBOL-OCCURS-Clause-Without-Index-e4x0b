01  WS-DATA-AREA.         
    05  WS-COUNT PIC 9(5) VALUE 0. 
    05  WS-ARRAY OCCURS 100 TIMES PIC 9(3). 

* This is a snippet of COBOL code with a potential bug. The problem 
* is the use of OCCURS clause without an index. 
* This could lead to unexpected results or abends depending on the program's use.

* In the program, if the program does not provide a proper index to access
* the array elements, it will not be able to correctly access or modify 
* values stored in the WS-ARRAY, leading to potential data corruption or
* program crashes during runtime. 

* To solve this the program needs a proper indexing technique such as using 
* subscripts to accurately access elements within WS-ARRAY.
